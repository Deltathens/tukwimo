There are 8 cases: Agent, Patient, Indirect Patient, Indirect Agent, Locative, Vocative, Benefactive, and Genitive. Case is marked with a suffix on the noun. See the [syntax section](https://github.com/Deltathens/tukwimo/blob/master/syntax/case.md) for information on when and how to use these cases.

Count is either singular or plural, and marked with a 'a' at the beginning for plural, and omitted when singular. If noun-root ends in a vowel, add glottal stop before the suffix and after the prefix if it begins in a vowel.
