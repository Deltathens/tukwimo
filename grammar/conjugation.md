## Conjugation

Verbs are conjugated with two suffixes arranged as such Verb-Aspect-Tense. Aspect is either Perfect or Imperfect, and Tense can Past, Present, or Future. The suffixes are:

Meaning|Perfect|Imperfect|Past|Present|Future
-------|-------|---------|----|-------|------
Suffix|(')e|(')o|c|j|zh

Gerunds are marked with a -(')ë at the end of the verb root.
Infinitives are marked by not inflecting.
The Glottal Stop(') is omitted when the verb ends in a consonant, and kept when it ends in a vowel.
