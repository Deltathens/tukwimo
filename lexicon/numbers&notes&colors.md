When used as numbers, they concatenate to form numbers where the rightmost number is the 1s place, the second rightmost is the 12s place, (they lose their final consonant, except the 1s digit) eg: pokeb is 13, kepok is 145.

When used as notes, they concatenate to form chords (they lose their final consonant, except the final note) eg: pokeb and kepok are both C# and B simultaneously, while pokeb would be preferred, because the lower tone is first.

In addition to the colors labeled in the table, there is White (Hexcode FFFFFF) and Black (Hexcode 000000), with names sëc and zhëz, respectively. To form more colors, concatenate in a similar fashion to numbers and notes, and the concatenation means the average of the hexcodes corresponding words.
