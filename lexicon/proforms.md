Personal Pronouns decline just like any other noun, and come in four variations: First Person, Second Person, Third Person, and Undefined Person.

Pronouns|First Person|Second Person|Third Person|Undefined Person
--------|------------|-------------|------------|----------------
Lexeme|wio|wäi|wuä|wë

There are other pro-forms, such as pro-verbs and other correlatives.
